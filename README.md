#  Factorio Mod - Aquatic Biters

## About Mod
This is a simple mod that will add to the game new type of enemy. Biters that will be able to attack from water. This is the idea that came up to me when i'm playing game with couple of mods adding to the game more water related content. And that was pretty op when player can expand thier factories into water but enemies not. So I decided to create simple mod that'll change that :)

## Main Features of new types of enemies
- New enemy type that will be able to move through water tiles
- New type of enemy bases in water tiles
- Those biters will be able to attack structures that are only near shores
- Biters won't be able to survive long time out of water tiles so they won't attack structures that are distanced from water

## Goals Road Map
1. Aquatic biters and water biter bases
2. Special wapons to defeat them

4. **Alpha Version Relese**
